I have always been a goal oriented person(like everyone is). I have so many goals that I want to acheive in my life, and of course... like everyone, I have no clue how to get there.

On June 13th I discovered that I want to learn how to be code. I started a cheap online course, and I realzied it was a great way to fast track my goals. I know that I want to have a life that I am rewarded based on my efficiency, not on my time spent doing something. 

I love the freedom that being a great Developer brings, I hope to one day become so competent at it, that my entire life isn't spent grinding a 9-5 job. This would bring me the resources and time to discover who I am, and what I love to do.
