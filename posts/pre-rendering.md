I come from a family of Mortgages, the majority of my brothers are Loan Officers and my Father Runs a mortgage company. When I graduated High School I decided that I was going to try out that industry as well. I worked as hard as I could and finally passed my Loan Originators exam. I was ready.

I started working in the industry right as interest rates were rising and the COVID-19 boom slowed down. I knew I was going to have to find other options, if I was going to be successful. I started looking into jobs near me, and I couldn't stand the idea of working for any of them. 

My friends and family had always told me that I was just smug and arrogant enough to be a realtor. I decided to try my hand at that. I bought an online course and started chipping away at the 120 hours of education I was required to watch. It. was. awful. 

I decided if I was going to put 120 hours of my life into something, then I might as well make it one of the best things I can do. My brother linked me an online coding course, and I started that same day. 

I worked as hard as I could on it for the next month, and here I am today, making a very average blog, that I am very proud of. I am going to continue working on getting better at this because it is truly something that I love to do.
